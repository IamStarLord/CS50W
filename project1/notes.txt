The sessionmaker call creates a factory. This factory
when called, creates a new session(which is a regular python class)
with the given configuration assignment. We typicaly configure the 
session to specify a an engine for connection resources.

The session generated will use the engine to aquire connection resources.
This association is setup using the bind argument.

Place the sessionmaker factory at the global level.
The factory can be used by the rest of the application 
as the source of new session instances.
